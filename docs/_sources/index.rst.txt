Welcome to inseminator's documentation!
=======================================

*(definition from dictionary.com)*

   a technician who introduces prepared :strike:`semen` **dependencies** into the :strike:`genital tract 
   of breeding animals` python classes, especially :strike:`cows and mares` pure classes with 
   proper IoC, for :strike:`artificial insemination` well coupled components and clear classes 
   signatures.

Python library for type-based dependency injection. Write code without global state
and noisy boilerplate. Inseminator is meant to be used in an entry-point layer of your
application and the only thing it requires is properly type-hinted classes 
dependencies.
